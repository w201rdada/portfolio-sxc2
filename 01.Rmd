## A beginning.

An average person in the United States has 5.6 spells of unemployment<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup> and each bout is roughly 3 months<sup>[1](#footnote1)</sup>. That's a total of a year and four months of unemployment in a life time of dealing with likely financial instability and the stresses that causes. The majority of that time spent is the time consuming end to end job search process including job search, job application, interviews and hopefully an offer weeks or months later. 

This is a equal-parts process problem and data flow/data match problem. 

<!--- add something about process problem has solutions with internet (e-apply) speeding up paper applications --->

The data flow and match problem is what we would like to focus on to solve.

## A middle.

Over 90% of recruiters use LinkedIn to source or vet candidates<sup>[1](#footnote2)</sup>. LinkedIn stores massive amounts of semantically rich online professional profiles and a recruiter can quickly find a list of individuals in a given area. However, it's much harder for a recruiter to narrow down that list to professionals who would be the top matches for their open position. The issue is that candidates list their experiences and skills (if at all) not by what recruiters will search they by.

<!--- add something about data science helping here --->

* Techniques / suggestions
  * Using people at company Y/Z, position X to gather required skills distribution
  * Using correlated skills to deduce skills you also have

```

## An end.

Using data science, we can figure out the experiences and skills you need to optimize your LinkedIn profile so that recruiters will be able to find you. This will help shorten the average 1.4 years of unemployment you face in your lifetime.
