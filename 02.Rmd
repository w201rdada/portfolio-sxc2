## A beginning.

35% of all households in America are growing food at home or in a community garden [citation needed], up 63% in the past decade in younger households. [citation needed] Despite the flourishing enthusiasm for home gardens, many folks do not have access to a plot of land or care to keep gallons of soil in their apartment. Hydroponics have been gaining momentum for hobbiests, but the cost and knowledge gap so far has prevented it from commonly rooting in households. 

*insert something about cost and knowledge*

*lots of dimensions to capture*

## A middle.

Using data science and pooled crowd sourced data, we can optimize yields for the optimal crops to affordabily grow produce in anyone's living quarters using hydroponics. 

Kelpie
Kelpie will collect data and send it via wifi to your smartphone, take pictures. 
collect data:
- pH, water temperature, air temperature, humidity
- NPK ratios, trace elements (overtime)
- aeration CO^2
- light cycles
- compost tea blends
- plant type

Kelpie Cloud 
- algorithms ran 

Based on the availibility of your natural compost, home conditions and desired output, data science can deduce the most productive plants to grow in your house. 

example:
aquarium waste + coffee grounds + egg shells + banana peel == fertilizer


## An end.

Smart hydroponics, Kelpie, has the ability to bridge the cost and knowledge gap for everyone to be able to grow food in their home. Using a cloud of crowd sourced data and prediction algorithms to lower the costs of required inputs, like fertilizer and water, to each grower's constraints, we can not only recommend the types of plants grown, but also optimize the yield.

good things:
- all components of hydroponics are reusable
- plans grow fast and lush, year round
- saves room, water can be recycled

gotchas:
- not a replacement for natural cycles (seasons) or yards or a walk in the forest
- not a replacement for local produce or farmers market
