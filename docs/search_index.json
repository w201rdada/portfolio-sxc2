["smarter-jobseeking.html", "1 Smart-Optimize my LinkedIn and Get Found by Recruiters 1.1 Jobseeker’s Wasted Potential 1.2 A Smarter Approach to Unemployment 1.3 The Future and Potential Pitfalls 1.4 Footnotes", " 1 Smart-Optimize my LinkedIn and Get Found by Recruiters Keywords LinkedIn profile, machine learning, optimze online presence 1.1 Jobseeker’s Wasted Potential An average person in the United States has 5.6 spells of unemployment (Labor Statistics 2018) and each bout is roughly 3 months (Labor Statistics 2018). That’s a total of a year and four months of unemployment in a lifetime of dealing with likely financial instability and the stresses that causes. The majority of that time spent is the time-consuming beginning to end re-employment process including job search, job application, interviews and hopefully an offer weeks or months later. This time and effort spent on the job hunt drains not only the resources of the individual job seeker, but also impacts the opportunity cost of potential labor on the larger economy. Breaking down the components of job search, we can see this is a equal-parts process problem and data flow or data match problem. The process aspect of job search has been steadily improving in the past decades, transitioning from print based job ads and resumes to online applications. However, the data match aspect of job search, has arguably, gotten worse. While previously, a recruiter can scan 30 or 50 paper resumes to find a suitable match, now we have applications in the hundreds or thousands for some job openings. Candidates take advantage of the ease through which they can one-click apply, and recruiters began to rely on software to help them sift through applications. Many of these systems, known broadly as Applicant Tracking Systems, are fallible and don’t always bubble up the best candidates. By using data science and machine learning to improve the data match problem in the job hunt for individuals, we can reduce the cost of unemployment for both the individual and overall economy. 1.2 A Smarter Approach to Unemployment Over 90% of recruiters use LinkedIn to source or vet candidates(Fottrell 2018). LinkedIn stores massive amounts of semantically rich online professional profiles and a recruiter can quickly find a list of individuals in a given area. In addition, they can keep tabs on active and updated profiles of candidates with relevant experience for any potential job openings. LinkedIn also has a toggle for job seekers to let recruiters know if you are open to a new job. With this platform, we have an ideal information data bank to source and match candidates. However, the matching algorithm in LinkedIn for any open position is far from perfect. Interviews with recruiters@interviews_recruiters] reveal that they use complicated boolean queries to find candidates with the right skill set. Another impactful issue is that experiences and skills from ideal candidates are often not explicitly listed or not represented by what recruiters will search they by. To mitigate these matching issues, we suggest the following: apply machine learning to LinkedIn profiles so that each profile is representative of that user’s experiences and skills utilize the optimized semantically rich LinkedIn profile as a model for canonical matching against a job opening The first suggestion includes a few techniques for constructing an optimized online professional profile. Foremost, we should create canonical objects for each skill so that variations of a skill map to the same skill. It should have experience level as an attached entity. These skills can be graphically linked to concrete measurable results, such as ‘architected SEO linkbacks on XYZ platform increasing traffic by 150%’. These skills would also have a rich taxonomy with semantic relationships between skills and experiences. After constructing a robust model for skills and experiences, we should try to fill in skill or experience gaps. First, we can infer missing skills by utilizing association rules within the individual profile. For example, if someone is experienced in Jquery and Angular, there’s a 99% chance they also know Javascript well. Second, we can further deduce missing skills and experiences by comparing similar positions at the same company division. If many Microsoft developers knows .NET, we can infer that developer X who works at Microsoft will also. Third, we can crawl related resources from that candidate, whether it’s their github repository, academic papers, online accolades, etc. to fill in more gaps. For the second suggestion, we want to query against an optimized model to match against a job opening, which would help the recruiter and the job seeker. This process can be done in the background instead of initiated by a recruiter via boolean searches. On the hiring side, a job description is posted online with relevant criteria set, location, position, required skills and preferred skills utilizing the same underlying skills and experience taxonomy from earlier. This would kickstart a query that matches the most relevant candidates, which would continuously run to push up the most relevant results. From the candidates perspective, this same matching algorithm would also surface the most relevant jobs. Using this updated job matching model, we can drastically cut down the noise of mediocre or bad match candidates, and refocus the job seeker on only the best options. The close to instantaneous feedback from the moment a job is posted or when a job seeker is available also will reduce time and resources currently spent on time-to-hire and time-to-reemployment. 1.3 The Future and Potential Pitfalls Using data science, we can figure out the experiences and skills you need to optimize your LinkedIn profile so that recruiters will match you as soon as you’re available to work. However, with any new technology that alter the status quo, there are consequences. First, sourcing recruiters may find their jobs replaced by an algorithm. Those recruiters may need to transition into adjacent fields, e.g. career coaches or counselors. Second, a machine may never be able to represent an individual completely and there are always outliers who may bring a spark to an organization which algorithms have a tendency to weed out. Third, folks who strongly value privacy of their data may feel violated since this would be a mandatory push to share your professional experiences online. On the other hand, the employed but undervalued, or underemployed market can also benefit from this technology. However, we’d like to focus on the unemployed first, which arguably has a larger social utility and greater individual happiness. In spite of the pitfalls, the status quo of unemployment should change. This technology will help shorten the 1.4 years of unemployment the average person face in their lifetime. With this, we’re able to be more financially stable, productive and happier working for a better-fit job. 1.4 Footnotes 1: Bureau of Labor Statistics, “Frequently Asked Questions” https://www.bls.gov/nls/nlsfaqs.htm 2: Market Watch, “How Recruiters Screen you on LinkedIn” https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-recruiters-screen-you-on-linkedin-2014-05-02 3: Jobscan Internal Interviews References "],
["SmartHydro-Kelpie.html", "2 Kelpie - Crowd Sourced Smart Hydroponics 2.1 Undeniable Bond with Mother Earth 2.2 Kelpie, the Bridge and the Guide 2.3 Kelpie and the Future 2.4 Footnotes", " 2 Kelpie - Crowd Sourced Smart Hydroponics Keywords hydroponics, machine learning, recommendation algorithms, crowd sourced, Kelpie 2.1 Undeniable Bond with Mother Earth 35% of all households in America are growing food at home or in a community garden (“Food Gardening in the U.S. at the Highest Levels in More Than a Decade According to New Report by the National Gardening Association - Garden.org” 2018), up 63% in the past decade in younger households. (“Food Gardening in the U.S. at the Highest Levels in More Than a Decade According to New Report by the National Gardening Association - Garden.org” 2018) Despite the flourishing enthusiasm for home gardens, many folks do not have access to a plot of land or care to keep gallons of soil in their apartment. Hydroponics, an alternative to backyard gardening, has been gaining momentum for hobbiests, but the cost and knowledge gap so far has prevented it from commonly rooting in households. Given the right knowledge and tools, hydroponics could grow fuller any-season plants cheaper than traditional methods. Part of the reason is that it can be optimized to deliver the ideal blend of macro and micro nutrients given controlled environmental factors. However, the margin of error for hydroponic gardening is small, and the knowledge associated has many complex dimensions which are not well documented or available. The solution is Kelpie - a smart gardening unit that uses massive amounts of crowd sourced hydroponic data and data science to prescribe a curated hydroponic grow process for the avid gardener. 2.2 Kelpie, the Bridge and the Guide With Kelpie, we can optimize yields for the best crops to affordabily grow produce in anyone’s living quarters. Kelpie is a submergable device which collects your environmental data and syncs via wifi to your smartphone. Growers can take pride and pictures of the lifecycle of their harvest and share it with the broader community. The Kelpie device collects data about your environment, e.g. ambient temperature ranges, humidity and light cycles. It will also collect advanced scientific measurements on your tap water, e.g. pH and mineral or chemical levels. Through the Kelpie app, you can specify your plant preferences, e.g. lushy greens or sweet tomatoes, and your preferred harvest schedules, e.g. a little a week or a full harvest every two months. You can also specify via the app what kinds of compost you have available to brew the perfect organic fertilizer from your household compost, e.g. used coffee grounds or egg shells. Utilizing all these inputs, the Kelpie RainCloud algorithm will construct the perfect hydroponic gardening guide for each user. New hydroponic gardeners can order their personalized beginner Kelpie kit, which includes all the equipment and seeds you need to start growing immediately. Kelpie will remind you when the water levels are low, or alert you to add a tablespoon of coffee grounds to lower the acidity of your water. Advanced hydroponic gardeners will have the option to dig deeper and germinate new seeds of knowledge. They can monitor the NPK and trace element ratios in their compost tea, or grow new exotic plants and contributing that growth data to the wider Kelpie community. The Kelpie Raincloud constantly learns and optimizes new data collected from individual growers. New compost ingredients that are a viable source of plant food are pushed to users to decrease and eliminate costs of buying fertilizer. New plants that are viable to grow under a personalized set of conditions are updated daily. Using machine learning image feature detection, we can detect common health issues with your plants and recommend solutions. Success Case Study Nested in a highrise in Downtown Seattle, John is an avid Keurig organics coffee drinker and has a 10 gallon fresh water aquarium. As an intermidiate hydroponics gardner, he was able to brew his own fertilizer tea using his aquarium waste water, coffee grounds and a banana peel. Using Kelpie, he’s able to sustain two Super Sweet 100 cherry tomato plants and four heads of romaine - John has a romaine and tomato salad every day for lunch. 2.3 Kelpie and the Future Hydroponics has a few advantages over traditional gardening: all components are reusable, the water can be recycled, plants grow fast and lush year round and can be very compactly vertically grown. Adding the intelligence of the crowd and cloud, Kelpie hydroponics has the ability to bridge the cost and knowledge gap for everyone to be able to grow food in their home. Using machine learning and prediction algorithms to lower the costs of required inputs, like fertilizer and water, we can not only recommend the types of plants grown, but also optimize the yield personalized to each indoor gardener. Kelpie hydroponics is not a replacement for sustainable locally sourced produce nor can replace the joy of sowing seasonal crops in the backyard garden. The ability to grow gardens indoors doesn’t decrease the importance of conservation of the wonders of nature outdoors. However, it is a bridge for folks who yearn for a little taste of mother earth in their living room in this increasingly vertical and space constrained world. 2.4 Footnotes 1: National Gardening Association, “Food Gardening in the U.S. at the Highest Levels in More Than a Decade According to New Report by the National Gardening Association” https://garden.org/learn/articles/view/3819/ "]
